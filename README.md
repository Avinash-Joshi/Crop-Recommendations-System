# Crop-Recommendations-System
This is training task of ASD data analytics
Predict which crop is best choice to sow according to certain conditions 

We took the data from kaggle then perform following steps:

1) Import libraries and read the csv files.
2) Then I made some plotting to see the correlation.
3) First I apply the linear regression model but its not giving good results. I applied in both ways scaled and without scaled data.
4) Then I also remove some independent variable which give score of 100% but at time of prediction the model is unable to predict result.
5) Then I applied decision tree classifier which give accuracy of 99% and predict the value correctly.
